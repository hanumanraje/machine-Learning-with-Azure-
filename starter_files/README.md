# Operationalizing Machine Learning Project

In this project, I use AutoML to train lots of models on the Bank Marketing dataset and deploy the best one to a REST endpoint that can be consumed by other applications. I then create a pipeline using the Azure SDK that will automate the model training process. This pipeline is itself deployed to an endpoint so it can be started with a simple REST API call.

For this project, there are 8 steps:

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
